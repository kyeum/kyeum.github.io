# Dreaming always be progressive engineer; love to do something creative and challengeable things. 

## KWANGWOO(EMMET) YEUM

 As a dedicated engineer, I was excited by the intriguing nature of human mechanisms, and I aspired to acquire greater expertise in humanoid robotics. 
 Because my laboratory participated in many humanoid competitions, I was able to pursue my passion in diverse fields by building new mechanisms and designing creative algorithms. My love for learning in various areas drove me to engage in the engineering field in both academia and industry. Motivated by receiving the Korea President Award in competition and inspiring experiences in leading industrial companies, I am keep on proceeding as a professional engineer.
