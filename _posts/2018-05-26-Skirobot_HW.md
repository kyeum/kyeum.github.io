# Hardware and Design in Ski Robot Challenge 2018
## Skiing Robot System
![title](/photos/Skirobot_body.png){: width="40%" height="40%"}

To mimic human motion, we used two four-bar linkage mechanism in one leg to reduce weak parts such as hip and ankle. We also used worm gear to control the ankles to get rid of unnecessary actuators and to make skiing motions. We chose pendulum and CMG model on the upper waist to prevent falling. 

## Skiing Robot Leg

Legs are consisted of double-four linkage system which can remove weak joint where there is a lot of force that might harm in the future.

## Skiing Robot Ankle

Minimized the axis by eliminating unnecessary skiing joint such as the ankle.

## Skiing Robot Pendulum

By using linear bush, we were able to add CMGâ€™s mass to the weight of the pendulum.

## Skiing Robot Prototype

Build prototype for examine the test process

## Skiing Robot Module
