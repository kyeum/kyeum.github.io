![title](/photos/2015 IRC.png){: width="50%" height="50%"}

Participating in the 2015 10th International Robot Contest with my RND laboratory team, we won the gold medal.
Our team consisted of 3 members, Seongwook In, Byeonggu Im, and myself.
There were 4 missions in the contest. Among the 4 missions, my task was to control the robot to run and play basketball. I mainly focused on making all the motions with servo motors checking the hardware of the robots.
