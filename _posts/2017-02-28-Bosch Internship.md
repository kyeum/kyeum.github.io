Designed a simulation system and tested Automotive Products at the Predevelopment Department.

By using the Matlab Simmechanics tool, I built a test model and made an environment system to check userâ€™s force and friction. I checked those before testing them onto the prototype and then, adjusted them to a real model. Not only did I learn simulation skills but also learned efficient communication and planning skills with team.
