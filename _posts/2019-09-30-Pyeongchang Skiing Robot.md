-Design and Control of Humanoid Ski Robot Platform(인간형 스키로봇 플랫폼의 설계 및 제어)-

 This paper describes a humanoid ski robot to participate in Ski Robot Challenge held by Korea Institute for Robot Industry Advancement invoking 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic. Based on ski thesis, we designed and controlled the high-weight humanoid robot to skiing like human. Ski robot do autonomous control on the slope which is as same as real ski contest using several sensor system and path planning control. With the difference in two legs, Ski Robot can turn and with ZMP control algorithm using pendulum and Gyroscope, ski robot could be stable while turning. Path planning, detecting flags with lidar and vision, checking robot location with GPS, Robot can control himself. In this regard, we made autonomous robot detecting flags and modifying the path.
