## Soft Robotics

I am considering next generation of soft wearable robots that use innovative textiles and creative mechanisms to provide a more conformal, unobtrusive and compliant means to interface to the human body.

As compared to a traditional exoskeleton, these systems have several advantages: the wearer's joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light.  These properties minimize the suit's unintentional interference with the body's natural biomechanics and allow for more synergistic interaction with the wearer.

For above goals, we need several ways to integrate for this system.

1. Modeling of soft actuators and wearable robots
2. Specific sensing and control(EMG, EEG)
3. Human machine Interface

Intersting field Soft Robotics : 

- SMA(Shape Memory Alloy)
- Soft actuators and Texture
- Augmenting human machine interface with ML,RLssh
