## Soft Robotics

I am considering next generation of soft wearable robots that use innovative textiles and creative mechanisms to provide a more conformal, unobtrusive and compliant means to interface to the human body.

As compared to a traditional exoskeleton, these systems have several advantages: the wearer's joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light.  These properties minimize the suit's unintentional interference with the body's natural biomechanics and allow for more synergistic interaction with the wearer.

For above goals, we need several ways to integrate for this system.

1. Modeling of soft actuators and wearable robots
2. Specific sensing and control(EMG, EEG)
3. Human machine Interface

Intersting field in Soft Robotics : 

- SMA(Shape Memory Alloy), Soft actuators and Texture, Augmenting human machine interface with ML,RL

## Soft Texture like Actuator

:Having actuators in normal exoskeleton are getting a limits to be industrialize. Further research in material and chemical will be necessary to overcome issues of current hard exoskeleton mechanism. Soft sensors, Soft actuators will lead next generation for the industry and for the human.

## SMA

: SMA is one good example for starting a soft robotics. It has not good efficiency but, it will have cheap and powerful solution for the exoskeleton. Thus control actuator of SMA, which has 1~2HZ(human locomotion) will be beneficial for further research. 

## Human machine interface

RL, ML mechanism interface for indivisual humans' health care.
: As consider the humans' mentality, people have more interested and care about their health when they directly see how healtier they become when they work out. This kinds of interface will be beneficial and will be future industrial products for the human being.
