# Software and Control in Ski Robot Challenge 2018
## Skiing Robot System

Skirobot Software should gather all the theises and algorithms to get it to fit the ski robot, and we should implement each program sources into one main program. I built the main system with MFC dialog based system. To be specific, the system has to be able to use all devices which are involved in Lidar, Zed, Motors. So it was necessary to combine all requirements for use all modules' communication and usability spec.
