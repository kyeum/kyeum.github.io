# Digital Halfbike Project
Half bike is a combination of a bicycle and a Segway. Using the usersâ€™ center of gravity, the half bike can change directions and by using the pedals, the half bike can move.

## User's Algorithm
1) Drive it like a Segway, changing directions with your body weight and balance.
2) With sensors on the pedals, the rear motor will activate and will help the users.
3) The center of Axis checked the angle of the half bike and with the help of a damper and spring, the half bike will move.
